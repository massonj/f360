# Fusion 360 scripts

Handy python scripts for Fusion 360, focused on what I use as a furniture maker.

The first (and currently only) script is one I use to export a parts list from designs I create. I based it on a few scripts I found online, but I made a few improvements to better work with the kinds of designs I like to make.
